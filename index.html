                        Kazi Nazrul Islamis the national poet of Bangladesh who is
                        especially recognised as a Bidrohi Kobi (rebel oet) aroundthe
                        country. Nazrul is a famous poet, musician and philosopher of
                        Bangladesh. The famous poet Nazrul's writings deal with the
                        revolution of that period of the British government. His
                        revolutionary attempt helped him to be a national poet of
                        Bangladesh. He has raised his voice against any kinds of fascism
                        and oppression and got popularity swiftly around the Indian
                        subcontinent.
